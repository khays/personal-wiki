There are so many useful tools for unix, I can't remember them all, but I can have a post that describes the ones that I don't use enough to remember them.

* `lpr` - send files to the defualt printing dialog
* `apropos` - Searches the man pages for names and descriptions, which is great to find a tool that will work with .pdf (or whatever) filetype
* `yum check` is a command that can fix issues with yum repos that aren't updating or the cache is broken, or whatever. I seem to have to use it often.
* `du -ch` will tell you how much space is being used up in the children directories and the `-h` will make it easy to read the number that is outputted.
* `watch -n1 [command]` will repeat a command every second, MAC OS needs to have this installed through *homebrew*
* `lnav` reads log files and allows you do some pretty neat things with it, take a look for the note called apache logs for more information.
* `pwgen -sncy 20` generates a number of passwords, tough to guess and exactly what you would wan't.
