## Talking to Exchange

Talking to exchange is hard, the only way that I have gotten it to really work is through davmail.

By setting up Davmail, you will be able to get it to work.

### Setup on local machine

I currently have the script running in `$HOME/.davmail` and if you want to run it, run `sh $HOME/.davmail/davmail.sh &`. The `&` at the end will allow you to run more than one command, or detach the command from the terminal, which is very handy.
