## ssh keys

You will not be able to use `authorized_keys` if you do not have you remote home dir set up correctly.

1. `home\user` needs to be writable by *user*
2. `home\user\.ssh` should only have the permission `700`
3. `home\user\.ssh\authorized_keys` should only have permission `600`
4. Make sure that the owner/group for all of these is `user` as well

## Creating a repo

Create a bare repo (without a working tree) will allow you to push and pull from it with ease.

### Remote Machine

1. Log into the remote machine and `cd` to the appropriate 
2. Create your repo `mkdir newrepo.git` and change to it
3. Initialize your bare repo `git init --bare`
4. Get the location of the path and save it for the config below `pwd`

### Create locally and change git config

1. Create a new directory to hold your new files
2. Initialize your report `git init`
3. Change the config to point to the bare repo created above `git remote add origin git@myrepo:/shared/repos/newrepo.git`
4. Add file and commit changes `git add .; git commit -a -m 'initial commit'`

If on your local machine you have an `.ssh/config` file specifying what to do, this is how you connect to that remote server: `user@alias:/locat/to/git`.

## Removing files from a Git repo

If you want to untrack files in a git repo, you do something like this

1. List all the files in the repo `git ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD`
2. Untrack the files by typing `git rm --cached filename`
3. Add that file name or directory to your `.gitignore` file so that it doesn't get picked up again.

## Using Git

So much to use Git, here a few useful commands

* `git ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD` - List all the files that are in a git repo
* `git merge mybranch`
