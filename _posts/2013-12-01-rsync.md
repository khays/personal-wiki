`rsync` is great for making two directories contain the same files without having to think about it, there are lots of options as well. 

		rsync -rtv --progress --bwlimit=65 [destination] [source]

Where

* `-r` is recursive
* `-t` retain the file's modification time
* `-v` to show what is going on (verbose)
* `--progress` shows the progress

## Don't kill your bandwidth

At home I have a painfully slow upload, I use `--bwlimit=65` to limit upload rate to 65Kb/sec.

## Remote destinations

This is a great way to transfer files to a server, espcially if you have been interuped a few times, rsync will manage the files for you and just make sure it work. For either the destination or source, use standard unix naming conventions `server-name.com:/tmp/`, you may need to specify a user.
