title: Dynamic DNS on Telus
tags: dns ddns ssh
---

I wanted the ability to ssh into my home machine, but telus gives me a dynamic ip address, so I needed to find a way to always have it updated. I could have created a script that just finds the ip address and write the ip address to a file in dropbox, but I wanted something a little more elegant.

I have set up a Dynamic DNS service with [Afraid.org](http://freedns.afraid.org/), which is a great way to get a free name server. Lots of good reviews, so I think that this is a relable service.

I looked for the smallest domain name I could and I gave it a one letter subdomain, now I am ready to rock.

## Tell Afraid.org my new ip address

When my ip address does change, I have a script running to update the Afraid.org. There is a lot of documentation on how to make this work, I followed this method from [perl.arix.com](http://perl.arix.com/).

After installing it, I had to add the script to cron, and I was good to go.

## SSH access to home machine

Now, I don't want to have open access to ssh from my computer, so I did a few changes. My ISP (Telus) won't allow you to access certain ports, ports like 22, or 80. First I had to change the ssh port on my mac, which was not as easy as it should have been. See this [discussion on apple support forum](https://discussions.apple.com/message/21840297#21167256)

I then created a firewall rule that would:

* Forward all traffic from port 22 to my machine
* As long as that traffic existing from a certain ip address

I **do not** want to allow anyone access to my machine, especially one that is stored on a free DDNS service (I do not know who will read that). Luckily I have a few VPS that require a key pair to work, but that is not neccessary if you want to let anyone in.

With all this great fun, this is making me want to get a [Raspberry pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) and setup my own little webserver at home, especially now that I know how to setup a dns.
