[Pass](http://zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/) is a great tool, a few things to keep in mind.

## Create a new key

To view the keys that you have on your system, run `gpg —list-keys`. This will show you something like

    /home/khays/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
	------------------------------
	pub   2048R/12345678 2012-11-05
	uid                  username <email@domain.com>
	sub   2048R/98765432 2012-11-05
	
	pub   2048R/56789123 2013-07-09
	uid                  username2 <email@domain.com>
	sub   2048R/19283746 2013-07-09
	
This tells me that there are two keys. If you want to use one of these keys with Pass, you need to use the *uid*, so you would do `pass init 56789123` to use the *username2* key.

## Change the key in Pass

If you already have an existing key and you would like to change to a new private key, you have to

1. Create a new key with gpg —key-gen
2. Make sure the key is imported into the gpg keyring, do `gpg —list-keys`, if it isn’t in there, you will have to run `gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import private.key` where *private.key* is the private key file.
3. to add this new key, simply go `pass init -e 56789123` and you will be able to add the new key to your password store.

### Add to .bashrc

I had to add something to the bashrc to make it work

	GPG_TTY=$(tty)
	export GPG_TTY
	
### auto-key-locate

I got a number of auto-key-locate errors on the Mac, turns out that this *feature* was causing problems, I simply uncommented the value in the conf file `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`
