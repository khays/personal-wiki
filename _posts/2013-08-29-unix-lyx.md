The local layout allows you to change the look and feel of the content when you are writing it, but not the final layout. So if you wanted to get rid of the indent and justify differently you would add this following to your document setting->Local Layout

    Style Standard
        Category        MainText
        Margin          Static
        LatexType       Environment
        LatexName       Body

        NextNoIndent    1
        ParSep          0.5
        ParIndent       MM 
        Align       Left
        TopSep          0.5
        BottomSep       0.5
    End
