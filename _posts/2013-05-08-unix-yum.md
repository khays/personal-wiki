## What am I getting?

    rpm -ql [package-name]

This will show you the contents of the package, which is very useful for finding what fonts are instaled with the `texlive-texmf-fonts.noarch`.

## What is installed on my machine

    rpm -qa

Show every pack that installed on your system with a lot of detail. If you know you package names, this will let you know where it comes from as well. Very useful.
