<p>Ever do something to your system configuration, then 5 months later, after you have wiped your hard-drive to try a different flavour of Linux, you have to re-configure your system. Every time I would start from scratch I would notice that I would have to search for the solution, again, often coming up to the same place I was 5 months ago.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m tired of that, this is my journal of configuration. Where I store the information that I need to get moving again, when I start from scratch, or need to reference something. </p>

<p><em>This is my manual, for me, written by me</em></p>

<p>You might find something useful in here as well, but the main reason this is online is to make it easy for me to search through my notes. If you would like to contact me, find my on <a href="https://twitter.com/hayskelly">twitter</a>.</p>
